# Introduction

This book is a practical guide to the technical side of the Africa Agriculture
Adaptation Atlas. Here you will find guidence on our data and methods with the
aim of making it easier for everyone to generate, share, and apply insights that
drive climate adaptation.

It is meant for anyone who wants to contribute. This can be through sharing
datasets, building new data explorations, or reusing the Atlas structure for
their own work.

The Atlas is built on collaboration. By combining expertise across climate,
agriculture, and development, it connects valuable data with the decision-makers
who need it most. To support this, we have designed the platform to be open,
adaptable, and easy to build upon.
