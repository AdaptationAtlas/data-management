# Phenology

This dataset provides subnational estimates of key seasonal metrics for crop and
vegetation systems, derived from remote sensing and climate data. It captures
temporal patterns in vegetation growth to support agricultural planning and
climate risk assessment.

## Start of Season (SOS) and End of Season (EOS)

This dataset provides subnational estimates of seasonal timing derived from
GLASS 8-day NDVI data using the
[Phenofit framework](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.13870)
and R package. ahhhh

### Dataset Overview

Start-of-season (SOS) and end-of-season (EOS) are derived primarily from the
**DER method** (maximum positive/negative derivative) and threshold-based
approaches (**TRS2**: 20% seasonal amplitude, **TRS5**: 50% seasonal amplitude).
These are the most robust indicators of green-up and senescence, while other
metrics such as logistic inflection points (UD, SD, DD, RD, Greenup, Maturity,
Senescence, Dormancy) are less reliable in regions with multiple or noisy
growing seasons. Users are advised to rely on DER values for seasonal analysis
and timing, but TRS2 and TRS5 may also be useful.

### Format

All SOS and EOS data are stored in Parquet format, with one file per country.
The definitions for the columns are shown below.

## Seasonal Rainfall

This dataset provides estimates of seasonal rainfall aligned with the start and
end of the growing season (SOS/EOS) derived from phenology data. Rainfall is
based on **CHIRPS v3** and is currently only processed for Kenya. It captures
the total precipitation occurring within each identified season, allowing
assessment of seasonal water availability for agriculture and climate risk
analysis.

Rainfall metrics are computed using the same seasonal delineation as the
phenology dataset, and the recommended variable for robust seasonal analysis is
**rain_der**. This use the DER method (maximum positive/negative derivative) for
SOS/EOS to produce more stable season lengths. Other thresholds (**rain_trs2,
rain_trs5, rain_greenup_senescence**) are also provided but are less robust.

### How to begin?

To start using the phenology dataset, first identify the country or region of
interest. Each country’s data is stored as a separate Parquet file, containing
per-pixel seasonal metrics. For analysis at broader scales, it is recommended to
**aggregate the data to administrative level 1 (ADM1)**, using the admin1_name
column in the dataset. Filtering and subsetting can be done based on the
provided quality statistics if needed (see below). Aggregation can be performed
by computing the mean, median, max, min, and other summary statistics of SOS and
EOS dates within each Admin 1 area. These admin 1 names match with the admin 1
names in the @sec-boundaries admin boundaries dataset. This allows for easier
comparison across regions and integration with other spatial datasets, such as
crop or livestock VoP and population exposure.
