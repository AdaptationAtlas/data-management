    "text": "2.1 The Atlas Philosophy\nThe Africa Agriculture Adaptation Atlas exists to strengthen adaptation programming across Africa through data-driven decision-making. Our goal is to create scientifically robust, data-rich insights that inform policies, guide investments, and support the design of effective adaptation programs.\nAt the heart of the Atlas are a series of interactive, open notebooks—designed to deliver answers for a specific topic quickly. These aim to be be user-friendly, scalable, and modular. We use a story-based approach, ensuring that each notebook delivers direct, specific insights tailored to users’ needs as quickly and clearly as possible.\nOur design principles are:\nCommunity – Build using tools that are familiar to technical scientists and researchers, lowering barriers and enabling data sharing and collaboration without requiring traditional web-development skills.\nModularity – Components are reusable, adaptable, and easy to combine into new data stories quickly and easily.\nOpenness – Anyone can contribute their datasets, methods, or narratives, making it easier to surface local and specialized knowledge. We use open-source tools and all of our code and data is openly available for anyone to build from, contribute to, and re-use.\nReusable – The same methods and workflows can be applied across different regions, themes, or datasets without starting from scratch.\nSustainability - The Atlas is designed to last for years to come. It uses tools which can easily be hosted on institutional servers, free hosting platforms (GitHub Pages, Observable HQ), and does not require expensive infrastructure or developers to maintain.\nBy combining flexible technology with a collaborative ethos, the Atlas makes it simpler for policymakers, researchers, and practitioners to see the data behind the decisions—and to adapt faster, together.",

    "section": "2.2 The Tech Stack",
    "text": "2.2 The Tech Stack\n\n\n\nAtlas Structure\n\n\n\n2.2.1 The Landing Page & Main Site\nThe Adaptation Atlas landing page is built with Next.js and TypeScript, using Sanity as a content management system (CMS) to manage and deliver content on the page. The application is hosted on our local Alliance servers and deployed as a Docker container for a streamlined, portable setup. The source code and Docker image can be used to replicate the system and can be found here along with documentation on how to set it up.\n[!NOTE] This is just the main website for the Adaptation Atlas. The notebooks (discussed in the next section), are completely standalone and are only linked to from this site.\n\n\n2.2.2 The Atlas Notebooks (Data Explorations)\nThe Atlas notebooks are fully modular, standalone, and self-contained, capable of running as static websites with no backend required. Built in Observable JavaScript (OJS), they use DuckDB WASM to query data directly from our S3 bucket efficiently based on user inputs. This allows all code and data processing to happen client-side, minimizing hosting costs and promoting sustainability, scalability, and development ease. Users can open, copy, modify, or import notebooks or notebook sections easily, enabling rapid creation of new analyses or data stories. Currently hosted on ObservableHQ, the notebooks are being migrated to the Atlas Notebook GitHub repository to further support reuse, collaboration, and improved management of issues and suggestions.\n\n\n2.2.3 The Atlas GitHub\nThe code used to create and analyze most Atlas datasets is openly available on our Atlas GitHub, ensuring transparent, reproducible, and open science principles. The repository also includes tools developed for the Atlas, designed to streamline the creation of notebooks and Quarto documents, as well as to simplify cloud data management and format conversion. These resources make it easier for others to replicate our workflows, adapt them to new contexts, and contribute back to the growing Atlas ecosystem.\n\n\n2.2.4 The Atlas S3\nAll Atlas datasets are stored in cloud-native formats—including Parquet, GeoParquet, and Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs) within an AWS S3 bucket. These formats are designed for efficiency, allowing tools like Apache Arrow, DuckDB, and GDAL to query and access only the data needed by the user, rather than downloading entire files. This approach dramatically reduces transfer times and computing costs, while enabling scalable, on-demand analysis directly from cloud storage. It also ensures our data remains open, interoperable, and ready to integrate into modern data workflows.\n\n\n2.2.5 The Atlas STAC\nAll Atlas data is cataloged using STAC (SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog), an open standard for describing geospatial data. STAC ensures every dataset is paired with rich, standardized metadata, making it easier to discover, search, and integrate data across projects. By adopting this community standard, we align with global best practices, enabling compatibility with a wide range of tools and platforms. STAC also supports filtering by time, space, and other properties, making it simple for scientists, policymakers, and developers to find exactly the data they need while ensuring long-term interoperability and re-usability.",

    "text": "3.1 Parquet & GeoParquet\nThe Adaptation Atlas leverages modern cloud-native data formats such as Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COGs), Parquet, and GeoParquet. These open, community-driven standards require no proprietary software or drivers, ensuring data is fully reproducible, easy to share, and accessible for years to come. These formats are designed to be incredibly efficient and scalable, making use of modern technologies such as cloud storage, distributed and parallel processing, partial reads, and modern compression algorithms. This means the atlas can handle and surface terabytes of geospatial data while providing users with the ability to access the specific rows, columns, or geographic regions needed for a task. The result is faster analysis, lower data transfer costs, and integration into client-side visualizations and large-scale analytical pipelines. By adopting these formats, the Atlas remains interoperable with a broad ecosystem of tools, supporting both immediate decision-making and long-term open science.\nAlthough cloud-native is in the name, these formats do not require hosting on cloud storage or working with massive datasets to deliver benefits. Their efficiency applies equally to data stored locally, on internal servers, or at any scale. Even small and local datasets gain from faster reads, lower storage needs, and easier interoperability. An excellent introduction to cloud-native geospatial formats can be found here.\nThe Adaptation Atlas uses Parquet as the final data storage step between our raster analysis pipelines and the datasets we surface to users through the adaptation Atlas Interface. These datasets are often our raster data that has been aggregated to boundaries (watersheds or administrative) and formatted as tabular data.\nGeoParquet, which is based on Parquet, is used for all of the geospatial vector data used in the Adaptation Atlas, such as administrative boundaries, watersheds, etc. We aim to follow the GeoParquet best practices as closely as possible. This ensures maximum interoperability between datasets and tools.\nThese Parquet and GeoParquet datasets enable efficient filtering by geometry, columns, and row attributes, for use in both in analytical workflows and directly within Atlas notebooks in the browser using tools like DuckDB-WASM and other client-side, browser-based processing tools. This allows increased performance and allows the Atlas to surface much larger datasets to users than would otherwise be possible using older formats such as CSV or GeoJSON while maintaining smaller file sizes and faster transfer times.",

Overviews in COGs also support efficient browsing and visualization when needed. Users of the Atlas may want to access and re-run analysis using our raw and processed raster data instead of the aggregated tabular data we provide through the Notebooks. By using COGs, users can access only the portions of raster data required for their analysis, such as specific layers or geographic regions, without downloading the full dataset. This reduces data transfer time and costs, while enabling analyses that would otherwise be impractical to individual users due to dataset size or memory and processing limitations.",

    "text": "4.1.1 Raw GAUL Boundaries\nThe raw GAUL boundaries represent the original FAO administrative boundaries with minor adjustments to support analysis. GAUL does not provide country-level (admin 0) boundaries, so both admin 0 and admin 1 boundaries in the Atlas were created by aggregating the admin 2 boundaries. Before aggregation, major water bodies included in GAUL were removed from the admin 2 boundaries. Admin 1 boundaries were quality-checked against the official GAUL admin 1 boundaries to ensure that the aggregation process preserved accuracy. The resulting “raw” boundaries therefore include:\n\nOriginal FAO geometries (admin 2) without major water bodies.\nAggregated admin 1 and admin 0 boundaries derived from the GAUL 2 geometries.\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Analysis Ready Boundaries\nAnalysis-ready boundaries extend the raw boundaries to better support data aggregation and reporting. These boundaries:\nIdentify disputed regions within the GAUL boundaries and assign them to all countries that claim them, ensuring that aggregated data matches national representations.\nInclude additional attributes to facilitate analysis and linking with other datasets.\nPreserve the same geometries as the raw boundaries, except where overlapping or unioned boundaries are required to account for disputes.\nThis approach ensures that the Atlas provides an accurate representation of FAO’s GAUL data while providing countries with data that is representative of how they represent their boundaries.\n\n\n4.1.3 Rasterized Boundaries\nIn addition to vector boundaries, the Atlas provides rasterized versions of administrative boundaries for use in zonal extractions. These rasters are available at all three administrative levels (0, 1, and 2) and use the numeric GAUL codes as the raster values.\nIt is important to note that these raster datasets are based on the raw GAUL boundaries described above and do not account for disputed areas. Overlaps in boundaries cannot be represented in a raster, so any treatment of disputed regions must be performed after the zonal extraction. Depending on the type of data, this can be done using simple summation or a weighted mean. To facilitate this, the Atlas provides a reference table listing each disputed area, the countries claiming it, and the area of each region.\n\n\n4.1.4 Simplified Boundaries\nTo ensure efficient rendering while retaining topological accuracy, we applied multi-resolution boundary simplifications using mapshaper. These simplified boundaries are based on the analysis ready boundaries and should be used for visualizations as their file size is significantly smaller than the analysis ready boundaries.

Following IPCC definitions, exposure is about “what is in harm’s way” rather than the sensitivity or adaptive capacity of the system. It captures the spatial distribution and extent of assets or populations that may experience climate-related events, such as extreme rainfall, drought, or heatwaves, and is a key component in assessing potential climate impacts and risks.\nThis dataset provides subnational estimates of the Value of Production (VoP), crop production (kg/ha), and harvested area (ha) for major crops across Sub-Saharan Africa. It is based on a version of MapSpam adapted for the African Agricultural Adaptation Atlas using 2020 production numbers. VoP was calculated by combining national FAOSTAT production, price, and value data with SPAM gridded crop production rasters, disaggregated by farming system (subsistence, low, high, irrigated). National VoP is spatially allocated to raster surfaces to show where economic value is concentrated, producing outputs in nominal USD per pixel. These rasters highlight the distribution of crop production value across space and farming systems, supporting assessments of economic exposure to climate hazards and informing adaptation planning.",

Aggregation can be performed by computing the mean, median, max, min, and other summary statistics of SOS and EOS dates within each Admin 1 area. These admin 1 names match with the admin 1 names in the Chapter 4 admin boundaries dataset. This allows for easier comparison across regions and integration with other spatial datasets, such as crop or livestock VoP and population exposure.",
